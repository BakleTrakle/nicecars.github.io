      <h5 class="center">Selling cars since 1982</h5>
      <p class="large">This company sells a large variety of old cars that are extremly hard to find these days. While for some it might seem something that is usless for others old cars are a treasure that we need to keep. </p>
      <p class="large text-grey hide-medium">Theres is also another major part our company does for it's customers. Another service we offer is upgrading old unusable cars with new parts for the whole vehicle if a costumer is intrested in it. There is a limit to what we can do but we mostly leave it to the costumer's imagination.</p>
